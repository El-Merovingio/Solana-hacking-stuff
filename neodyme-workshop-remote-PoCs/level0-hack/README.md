# Important
Here we'll find two approaches.
- cicd.sh -> Uses poc_framework 
- navive.sh -> Uses native instructions

In order to use both, first we have to run `solana-test-validator --reset` then the script. I.E. 
`solana-test-validator --reset`
`./cicd.sh`

Its strongly recommended to cancel the test validator each time we want to use the another way.
