- The original (tested) code was forked from the Neodyme repo: https://github.com/neodyme-labs/neodyme-breakpoint-workshop/
- The levels are included in their own folder, so in order to test the PoCs, I recommend you to test one folder at a time
- Each folder (level{x}-hack) has its own original code and the related PoC, please, modify the `level{x}-hack/pocs/Cargo.toml` with your internal URIs
