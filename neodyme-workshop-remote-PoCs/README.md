# IMPORTANT
- The original (tested) code was forked from the Neodyme repo: https://github.com/neodyme-labs/neodyme-breakpoint-workshop/
- The levels are included in their own folder, so in order to test the PoCs, I recommend you to test one folder at a time
- Each folder (level{x}-hack) has its own original code and the related PoC, you can run:
	- solana-test-validator --reset
	- In another terminal you can run: `chmod +x cicd.sh && ./cicd.sh`
	- To reset the programs, you can un: `chmod +x reset.sh && ./reset.sh`
